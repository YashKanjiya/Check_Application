# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. **NumPy** - for numerical and matrix operations.
# 2. **Pandas** - for data manipulation and analysis.
# 3. **Matplotlib** - for data visualization.
# 4. **Scikit-Learn** - for machine learning and data preprocessing.
# 5. **TensorFlow** - for deep learning and neural networks.

# Exercise 10 - Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives
# 
# Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as List popular languages for Data Science.
# Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 10-objectives.png (Images can be saved with either the .jpg or .png extension.)
